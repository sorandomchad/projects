<br />
i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual:
either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i
can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i
forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the
simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater
salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i
know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to
make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy
way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year
old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to
only wear leather shoes dress shoes.<br />

about you:<br />
<br />
you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about
really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a
light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you
have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons
with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still
at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the
wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my
favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a
good attention span.","currently working as an international agent for a freight

38,thin,anything,socially,,graduated from masters program,"i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online
dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as
earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before
the world.<br />
<br />
i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find
myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and
acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on
this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that
aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a
friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex
filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle
statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text
without moving quickly on to another search result, you are
probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at
first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid
you, but that seems silly.<br />
<br />
as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of
the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you
get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that
while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and
by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that
way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself
gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are
too.","i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to
indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from
the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more
concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual
form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance,
noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at
least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven
activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi
to try and gently flirt with ego death.","improvising in different contexts. alternating between being
present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both
at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said
conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that
transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening
to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large
gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and
raunchy humor.","my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people
comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an
unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more
directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back
to this.","okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like
being in the crosshairs.<br />
<br />
for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than
fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text
by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille,
baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll
often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix
as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco,
perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i
was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.<br />
<br />
directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky,
herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang,
gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc.
but i also like a good amount of ""trashy"" stuff. too much to
name.<br />
<br />
i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long
form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which
a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv
favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the
prisoner, lost, fringe.<br />
<br />
a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay:
art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers,
maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings,
omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk,
robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit,
juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b'more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz,
techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc.<br />
<br />
a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my
sensibility: andy warhol, bruce nauman, yayoi kusama, louise
bourgeois, tino sehgal, george kuchar, michel duchamp, marina
abramovic, gelatin, carolee schneeman, gustav metzger, mike kelly,
mike smith, andrea fraser, gordon matta-clark, jerzy grotowski,

appreciated. there is something special in each and every moment
that you experience in your daily waking life. this something
brings us back to the age old question: if a tree falls in the
forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? this
works in the same way. if you are not consciously there to hear it,
see it, taste it, smell it, feel it none of this matters, it's
still there. pay attention to the little things, those that are

call life.","plotting to take over the world with my army of segway riding

28,average,mostly anything,socially,never,graduated from college/university,"i was born in wisconsin, grew up in iowa, and moved to california
three years ago for a combination of work opportunity and just
wanting to live in sf. it took me a couple years to get to the
peninsula, but i'm glad i eventually got here. i'm passionate about
people and have a wide variety of interests and talents.<br />
<br />
i'm also continually learning about myself. for example, i'm
learning very recently that as a result of spending all my time
growing up, in college, and for the last five years focusing on
growing my ""deep relationship"" skills, i'm not as good as i
previously thought at initializing friendships/relationships. i
guess that isn't all a bad thing since the ""first impression"" thing
only really happens once with each person. :)<br />
<br />
as a result, i love my friends, i've got a lot of deep friendships,
and know how much richer a friendship can get as it gets
deeper.<br />
<br />
i'm passionate about music, i play the guitar, write songs (less
now than before), write plays (more now than before), want to learn
french and asl, am pretty good for an amateur ballroom dancer, can
do almost everything moderately well (seriously, no joke), love
bright ties and shoes, am a jacket and jeans person, and absolutely
love figuring out how people tick. i think i'm pretty cool and wish
more people would be patient enough to take the time to see
that.<br />
<br />
every friend i've ever had say i'm nothing like anyone else. so i
don't come off like anyone else. i'm my own person. and i'm proud
of that.","i'm currently the youngest member on an internal strategy team for
a large bank. it may sound boring, but i'm a big fan of the
opportunities it entails. i get to be exposed to really
intelligent, deliberately organized people be purposeful in a high
paced business environment. it's pretty awesome soaking up all
their knowledge while contributing what i can.<br />
<br />
i'm happy with who i am and would enjoy adding someone else to the
mix.","i'm really good at a little bit of everything. there isn't much i
truly excel in, but i'm above average to good in almost every area.
i take pride in being able to do a lot of different things. for
example, i have a tiny bit of talent/skill in writing,
wood-carving, cooking, singing, playing a guitar, drawing, sewing,
etc. i grew up in a household that had to make a lot of the things
we needed, so you kind of picked up these things along the way.","the way i dress. some days it's hats, other days it's different
ties. most days it's shoes and jackets. just another way to express
myself.<br />
<br />
i've also decided that people notice how i'm not what they
expected. i find myself unpurposefully continually surprising
people, and i think i like that. :)","books = yes. avid reader.<br />

don't even really play video games all that often. i actually
create/play music way more often in my spare time.<br />

i'm starting a new life here in ca and really excited about it. i
only knew one person in this area when i moved here, but i wasn't

lived, i've made at least a few life-long friends. i'm definitely
looking to do the same thing here.<br />

lifestyle. i'm really looking forward to doing some camping,
backpacking, biking, etc in ca. i also really enjoy going out for a
nice meal and some tasty cocktails or beer, or doing the music
nightlife thing. i dj (drum n bass) from time to time, and i've
already landed a few gigs in the bay area. i'm very much involved
in dnb and other electronic genres, but i love live music just as

somewhat vulgar flare (i hope you can take a joke-offensive or
not).<br />
<br />
i'm a constant seeker of discovering something new, whether it be a
different restaurant, culture, or music (anything really). i tend
to have an eclectic personality.<br />
<br />
i volunteer and participate with a lot of activities with my
community. i also tend to seek those who have a story, any story.
i'm all ears! i want to learn from you, hear what you have to say,
and relate it to my own personal experience.<br />

i'm a bit of a nerd and like to watch the history, military, and
discovery channel. something about militaristic strategies intrigue
me.<br />

video games, and working out consistently. i also have the guilty
pleasure of watching ridiculous comedy (family guy, curb your

rationally thinking. i find this to be extremely rare

i'm really good at tinkering with things on the side, being that i
crave discovery and self knowledge, so in a sense i'm good at
figuring things out on my own.","physically-i've been told my eyes. people usually like how i can
turn a serious situation into something relaxing and fun. i tend to
make shy people ""talk"" to me...but i keep hearing that's a plus.","i'm much more of a movie goer. favorite actor: edward norton.
favorite actress : rachel weise. favorite director: darren
aronofsky . that should give you a pretty good idea of the type of
movies i like.<br />

i absolutely love to dance! nothing is a better stress reliever
than hitting the dance floor with good company.<br />
<br />
hands down though, my ultimate love affair with music is
essentially classic rock. the scorpions are absolutely my favorite
band because they bring a smile to my face every time i hear them.
they were also the best concert i've ever attended.<br />

opportunities... you name it. i am a social animal and appreciate

mannerisms, i seem like quite the ""typical"" guy: i love to drink
beer, play sports, i listen to reggae, dubstep and hip-hop, and
enjoy a beach full of bikini-clad women as much as anyone. however,
yes, i can also be a bisexual, swinging, polyamorous, and
debaucherous individual. but that is just a part of me, and all
that really means anyway is i'm open minded. i have always fully
imagined marrying and having kids one day, but i'm open to whatever
life may bring. while i am secretly and totally a hopeless
romantic, i am not trying to rush in to things or grow up too
fast.<br />

still adventurous... i try not to take the day-to-day of life too
seriously. :-)<br />

a note on ""bisexuality"":<br />
for you hetero-normative folk: do not be afraid of the term
""bisexual"". it is just a term, and a very limiting one at that. i
am just as heterosexual as a ""straight man"". i am just as
homosexual as a ""gay"" man. and just because i may be bisexual and
perhaps polyamorous, does not mean that i am unable to be in a
happy, committed, and fulfilling relationship with a single
partner. in fact, such an arrangement has been my norm.","i am living. bartending, schooling, rocking out to my radio...

by day, i'm a mild-mannered designer in an office. by evening, an
inventor, artist, and adventurer. by night, a competition dancer
and jet-setter to fun and glamour.<br />
<br />
""oh - you're a designer?"" you say. ""that's interesting!"" you lie.
exactly! ""designer"" is a great thing to be, because you can put it
on forms and stuff to answer the ""what do you do?"" question without
actually answering it. ""designer"" tells you nothing. i could be
working in fashion, cars, systems, furniture, ads, events,
landscapes, websites, aircraft, or anything! ""ah yes, very clever,
haha etc etc. so what kind of designer are you then?"" well, some of
you reading this will have purchased my work. that kind of designer

sound british to most americans, australian to some, but while
these are good guesses, neither is quite correct.<br />

is the gayest straight man in the world - he has good taste, knows
how to decorate, has a real sense of style"".<br />

clearly she completely failed to notice my impressive aura of
menace and seductive evil radiating across the land. actually,
no-one seems to notice it. i think my aura might be broken.<br />
<br />
a friend i met on this site just called me ""a rare gem in the
wasteland of okstupid"". i hope there is a gem around here somewhere
for me!","i like books &amp; movies &amp; music, just like you!<br />
<br />
i'm not actually much of a believer in seeking out only people that
you have lots in common with. it might be easier to go on a date if
you're both always wanting to see the same movies, but i think the
really great times are often the ones where you end up doing
something you've never done before (and never dreamed you would),
because the other person's different interests give you access to
worlds that you probably wouldn't stumble into without them.
through each other, you both end up more magnificent!","i have whatever is the opposite of chronic depression - i am pretty
much hardwired to remain happy, regardless of what is going down.
so i figure i won at least one of life's major lotteries.<br />
<br />
on a different tack, i once lost mobility due to my leg being
sliced open when i accidentally... er... i mean... in the midst of
battle while i was fending off dozens of those bad guys from the
lord of the rings films. yeah - dozens! anyway, i got so sick of
not being able to do stuff, that i eventually ended up at a big new
year's bash a few weeks later, dancing through the painkillers,
doing my leg no favours, but having a blast. thus, i think dancing
would probably be on the list. as to the other four things, they're
classified. may i see your security clearance please? wait - you're
telling me you don't have a security clearance? sir/maam, this is a
restricted area. if you would like clearance, you will need to step
over here for the security screening...","i like the often refreshingly blunt and uncomfortable insights
about us that are laid bare by oktrends.<br />
<br />
on the subject of oktrends, you might notice that my profile says
i'm 6'2"" tall. but if we measure in okcupid inches, i'm nearly
6'4""! we know this because oktrends cleverly deduced that men here
inflate their height by an average of 2"", while i happen to know
that i only inflated mine by a fraction of an inch, so as to get a
round number. (clearly i'm a rebel, living dangerously! or
something).","once upon a time i might have been out conversing and dining with
friends, but then i moved here where i don't know anyone. perhaps
i'd be out dancing somewhere. perhaps at home, working on secret
projects. ask me.","you wouldn't believe me anyway, so nevermind. :-p<br />
<br />
random fact: i was bitten by a (presumably) radioactive insect,
exploring the exclusion zone at chernobyl. any day now i'll
discover my super-powers. any day...<br />
<br />
another (not very) secret:<br />
i get lower auto insurance premiums than you - despite being male
and having a (very) fast car. how is that fair? well, there's a
trick to it...<br />
but i plan to get an electric car and build my own solar powerplant
to help fuel it. (i've done a bunch of smaller solar projects. i
love the permanence of it - building something that can run forever
- the other parts will fail before the power source does.)","you're participating in the human trials of the oragenics

did i visit your profile more than once but not send you a message?
that's because email is a pretty lousy way to try to meet someone,

with it, i try not to bandy about things that they would rather
keep private.<br />

good enough and i'm smart enough and gosh darnit, people like me""
way. you know from the depth of your being that you are an amazing
individual and you're looking for someone who can appreciate
everything you are. you probably still worry sometimes about what
people think of you, but that's only because you surround yourself
with other intelligent, creative, interesting, physically fit
people like yourself. who doesn't occasionally get intimidated in
that company?<br />
<br />
you appreciate the physical beauty of the human body. you are a
very sensual being. human touch is very important. hugs, kisses,
massage, and sex. people skirt around the topic of sex all the
time, but lets face it, sex is a very important aspect of a
relationship for someone like you or me and there's no point
wasting our time in a situation where the sex is less than
phenominal. i'm excited to hear about your turn-ons and
fantasies.<br />
<br />
money is not really an issue for you - not because you're obscenely
rich, that's not really important. i just mean that you have no
trouble making the life you want for yourself. you appreciate that
we are a very gifted, fortunate people to live as we do.<br />
<br />
you give back to this wonderful community you live in.<br />
<br />
you love to keep in shape by doing things, as opposed to just going
to the gym for an hour a day. mt biking, rock climbing, surfing,
kite surfing, running, hiking, snowshoeing, telemark, snowboarding,
road biking, swimming, tai chi, qigong, and yoga all sound
interesting to you even though you haven't tried them all yet.
maybe you won't even like all of them, but at least you're excited
to give them all a try.<br />
<br />
you are not a serial monogomist. you are independent and
comfortable being alone. it's fun to date and meet new people, but
you're not going to settle for anything less than you deserve.
ultimately you crave a relationship you can commit to for the rest
of your life. you are looking for a loving relationship based on
good communication and trust.<br />
