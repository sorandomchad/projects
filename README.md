## About Me
Hi there! I am a recent Computer Science and Math graduate looking to improve my skills. Currently, my main interests are Machine Learning and NLP, but I still pick up an Abstract Algebra or a Toplogy book from time to time. I realized that to improve technically and challenge my fears, I need to take a step out of my comfort zone. This repo is my exposure therapy.
